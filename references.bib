of financial fraud allied with it are also intensifying and which 
results in trouncing of billions of dollars worldwide each year. 
Fraud detection involves scrutinizing the behavior of 
populations of users in order to ballpark figure, detect, or steer 
clear of objectionable behavior: Undesirable behavior is a 
extensive term including delinquency: swindle, infringement, 
and account evasion. Factually, swindle transactions are 
speckled with genuine transactions and simple pattern 
matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those 
frauds accurately. In this survey we, will focuses on 
classifying fraudulent behaviors, identifying the major sources 
and characteristics of the data based on which fraud detection 
has been conducted. This paper provide a comprehensive 
survey and review of different techniques to detect the 
financial fraud detection used in various fraud like credit card 
fraud detection, online auction fraud, telecommunication 
fraud detection, and computer intrusion detection.},

**What is RMT?**
- **Imbalance of the virtual economy**: The most critical influence is on economic balance. Dealing with a huge amount of virtual currency for RMT causes inflation in the virtual world and hampers the ability of general players to perform ordinary economic activities.
- **Direct harm of general players**: RMTers often directly harm other general players by, for example, occupying specific locations for obtaining currency and items and attacking other players to rob their properties.
- **Encouragement of unauthorized deeds**: RMTers also perform dishonest actions, such as cheating, using bots, and even taking over characters by fraud.
- **Discouragement of honest players**: The unfair advantages of RMTers discourage honest players and often prompts them to quit the game. It also prevents new players from joining the game

**Handing RMT**
- **Step 1. Identify suspects**: Operators identify characters suspected of involvement in RMT on the basis of, for example, tip-offs from general players or selfadvertisements of RMTers.
- **Step 2. Verify each suspect**: Operators verify whether each suspect is an RMTer or not by referring to his/her previous actions and utterances in log data that are accumulated in the game server.
- **Step 3. Ban the account**: Once a player is determined to be an RMTer, operators ban the account with/without exhortations. Players are allowed to use multiple characters in many MMORPGs, so all the characters operated by the same account are disabled.

**Roles in RMT**
- Sellers: Sell virtual property to general players and earn currency in the real world.
- Earners: Acquire virtual property, such as currency and items, from the virtual world, non-player characters (NPCs), and general players by repeating specific actions in the virtual world.
- Collectors: Convey virtual property from earners to sellers.},
