Fraud detection involves scrutinizing the behavior of 
populations of users in order to ballpark figure, detect, or steer 
clear of objectionable behavior: Undesirable behavior is a 
extensive term including delinquency: swindle, infringement, 
and account evasion. Factually, swindle transactions are 
speckled with genuine transactions and simple pattern 
matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those 
frauds accurately. In this survey we, will focuses on 
classifying fraudulent behaviors, identifying the major sources 
and characteristics of the data based on which fraud detection 
has been conducted. This paper provide a comprehensive 
survey and review of different techniques to detect the 
financial fraud detection used in various fraud like credit card 
fraud detection, online auction fraud, telecommunication

Furthermore, we extend the applicability of transformation-based methods to non-image data using random affine transformations. Our method is shown to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy and is applicable to broad data types. The strong performance of our method is extensively validated on multiple datasets from different domains.},

  abstract  = {Anomaly detection has been used for decades to identify and extract anomalous components from data. Many techniques have been used to detect anomalies. One of the increasingly significant techniques is Machine Learning (ML), which plays an important role in this area. In this research paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which analyzes ML models that detect anomalies in their application. Our review analyzes the models from four perspectives; the applications of anomaly detection, ML techniques, performance metrics for ML models, and the classification of anomaly detection. In our review, we have identified 290 research articles, written from 2000-2020, that discuss ML techniques for anomaly detection. After analyzing the selected research articles, we present 43 different applications of anomaly detection found in the selected research articles. Moreover, we identify 29 distinct ML models used in the identification of anomalies. Finally, we present 22 different datasets that are applied in experiments on anomaly detection, as well as many other general datasets. In addition, we observe that unsupervised anomaly detection has been adopted by researchers more than other classification anomaly detection systems. Detection of anomalies using ML models is a promising area of research, and there are a lot of ML models that have been implemented by researchers. Therefore, we provide researchers with recommendations and guidelines based on this review.},

Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.},

  abstract  = {Online gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry that entertains a large, global population. However, one unfortunate phenomenon known as real money trading harms the competition and the fun. Real money trading is an interesting economic activity used to exchange assets in a virtual world with real world currencies, leading to imbalance of game economy and inequality of wealth and opportunity. Game operation teams have been devoting much efforts on real money trading detection, however, it still remains a challenging task. To overcome the limitation from traditional methods conducted by game operation teams, we propose, MVAN, the first multi-view attention networks for detecting real money trading with multi-view data sources. We present a multi-graph attention network (MGAT) in the graph structure view, a behavior attention network (BAN) in the vertex content view, a portrait attention network (PAN) in the vertex attribute view and a data source attention network (DSAN) in the data source view. Experiments conducted on real-world game logs from a commercial NetEase MMORPG( JusticePC) show that our method consistently performs promising results compared with other competitive methods over time and verifiy the importance and rationality of attention mechanisms. MVAN is deployed to several MMORPGs in NetEase in practice and achieving remarkable performance improvement and acceleration. Our method can easily generalize to other types of related tasks in real world, such as fraud detection, drug tracking and money laundering tracking etc.},

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.},

We perform an exploratory logistic regression analysis to identify salient descriptive statistics followed by a machine learning binary classification problem to identify a set of features for classification purposes. Given the cost associated with investigating gold farmers, we also give criteria for evaluating gold farming detection techniques, and provide suggestions for future testing and evaluation techniques.},

  abstract  = {Anomalies in esports refer to situations when something unexpected or unlikely happens. Rapid performance changes, unusual strategies, extraordinary plays, accelerated resource gains or team wipeouts comprise examples, but anomalies fundamentally comprise any situation where something unexpected happens. In multi-player online esports games such as multi-player online battle arena games, anomalies form a key component of the commentator-driven storytelling. In fast-paced, complex esports titles, anomalies can however go undetected until it is too late for commentators to note them and use them in their coverage, and for viewers they can take place outside the viewable area of the broadcast stream. Furthermore, there are limited tools available for commentators and players across professional and amateur levels for analysing or categorising anomalies. The research presented here provides a novel approach towards identifying one type of outliers in esports matches, via the application of archetype analysis to extract novel insights that can be used by commentators to improve esports coverage. As a case example, the major esports title League of Legends is used. We present a viable methodology for utilizing distributions resulting from the archetypal clusters and reconstruction errors to expose and explain anomalous events during gameplay.},

A good deal of research has been performed in this area, often using strings or attribute-value data as the medium from which anomalies are to be extracted. Little work, however, has focused on anomaly detection in graph-based data. In this paper, we introduce two techniques for graph-based anomaly detection. In addition, we introduce a new method for calculating the regularity of a graph, with applications to anomaly detection. We hypothesize that these methods will prove useful both for finding anomalies, and for determining the likelihood of successful anomaly detection within graph-based data. We provide experimental results using both real-world network intrusion data and artificially-created data.},

  abstract  = {Outlier detection is a fundamental issue in data mining and machine learning. Most methods calculate outlier score for each object and then threshold the scores to detect outliers. Most widely used thresholding techniques are based on statistics like standard deviation around mean, median absolute deviation and interquartile range. Unfortunately, these statistics can be significantly biased because of the presence of outliers when calculating these statistics. This makes their use inaccurate. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-stage thresholding method (2T). Most obvious outliers are first removed by using a more conservative threshold, and the same process is then repeated for the processed scores. Experiments show that this two-stage approach significantly improves the results of all the three existing thresholding techniques.},
