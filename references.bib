Fraud detection involves scrutinizing the behavior of 
populations of users in order to ballpark figure, detect, or steer 
clear of objectionable behavior: Undesirable behavior is a 
extensive term including delinquency: swindle, infringement, 
and account evasion. Factually, swindle transactions are 
speckled with genuine transactions and simple pattern 
matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those 
frauds accurately. In this survey we, will focuses on 
classifying fraudulent behaviors, identifying the major sources 
and characteristics of the data based on which fraud detection 
has been conducted. This paper provide a comprehensive 
survey and review of different techniques to detect the 
financial fraud detection used in various fraud like credit card 
fraud detection, online auction fraud, telecommunication 
fraud detection, and computer intrusion detection.},

Recently, classification-based methods were shown to achieve superior results on this task. In this work, we present a unifying view and propose an open-set method, GOAD, to relax current generalization assumptions. Furthermore, we extend the applicability of transformation-based methods to non-image data using random affine transformations. Our method is shown to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy and is applicable to broad data types. The strong performance of our method is extensively validated on multiple datasets from different domains.},

  abstract  = {Anomaly detection has been used for decades to identify and extract anomalous components from data. Many techniques have been used to detect anomalies. One of the increasingly significant techniques is Machine Learning (ML), which plays an important role in this area. In this research paper, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which analyzes ML models that detect anomalies in their application. Our review analyzes the models from four perspectives; the applications of anomaly detection, ML techniques, performance metrics for ML models, and the classification of anomaly detection. In our review, we have identified 290 research articles, written from 2000-2020, that discuss ML techniques for anomaly detection. After analyzing the selected research articles, we present 43 different applications of anomaly detection found in the selected research articles. Moreover, we identify 29 distinct ML models used in the identification of anomalies. Finally, we present 22 different datasets that are applied in experiments on anomaly detection, as well as many other general datasets. In addition, we observe that unsupervised anomaly detection has been adopted by researchers more than other classification anomaly detection systems. Detection of anomalies using ML models is a promising area of research, and there are a lot of ML models that have been implemented by researchers. Therefore, we provide researchers with recommendations and guidelines based on this review.},
